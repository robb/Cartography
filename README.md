Using Cartography, you can set up your Auto Layout constraints in declarative code and without any stringly typing!

In short, it allows you to replace this:

<img src="/images/pirates2.png" align="right" height="280px" hspace="30px" vspace="30px">

```Swift
addConstraint(NSLayoutConstraint(
    item: button1,
    attribute: .Right,
    relatedBy: .Equal,
    toItem: button2,
    attribute: .Left,
    multiplier: 1.0,
    constant: -12.0
))
```

with this

```Swift
constrain(button1, button2) { button1, button2 in
    button1.right == button2.left - 12
}
```

If you end up using Cartography in production, I'd love to hear from you. You can reach me through [Twitter] or [email].

## Usage

Call the `constrain` function with your `UIView` or `NSView` instances as well
as a closure in which you declare the constraints between the different
attributes of your views:

```swift
constrain(view1, view2) { view1, view2 in
    view1.width   == (view1.superview!.width - 50) * 0.5
    view2.width   == view1.width - 50
    view1.height  == 40
    view2.height  == view1.height
    view1.centerX == view1.superview!.centerX
    view2.centerX == view1.centerX

    view1.top >= view1.superview!.top + 20
    view2.top == view1.bottom + 20
}
```

<img src="/images/pirates1.png" align="left" height="220px" hspace="20px" vspace="10px">

For every view on the left hand side of an equality or inequality operator,
Cartography will automatically set its
`translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints` property to `false`.

If the view is
not controlled by you–for example _if it belongs to a Apple-provided
`UIViewController` class_–you should take appropriate care when declaring its
constraints.

## Replacing constraints

You can capture multiple constraints in a group to then replace them with new
constraints at a later point.

```swift
constrain(view) { view in
    view.width  == 100
    view.height == 100
}

let group = ConstraintGroup()

// Attach `view` to the top left corner of its superview
constrain(view, replace: group) { view in
    view.top  == view.superview!.top
    view.left == view.superview!.left
}

/* Later */

// Move the view to the bottom right corner of its superview
constrain(view, replace: group) { view in
    view.bottom == view.superview!.bottom
    view.right  == view.superview!.right
}

UIView.animateWithDuration(0.5, animations: view.layoutIfNeeded)
```

For convenience, the `constrain` functions also returns `ConstraintGroup`
instances:

```swift
let group = constrain(button) { button in
    button.width  == 100
    button.height == 400
}
```

## Supported attributes


Cartography supports all built-in attributes as of iOS 8 and OS X 10.9, those are:

<img src="/images/pirates3.png" align="right" height="400px" hspace="20px" vspace="100px">

- `width`
- `height`
- `top`
- `right`
- `bottom`
- `left`
- `leading`
- `trailing`
- `centerX`
- `centerY`
- `baseline`

as well as the iOS specific

- `firstBaseline`
- `leftMargin`
- `rightMargin`
- `topMargin`
- `bottomMargin`
- `leadingMargin`
- `trailingMargin`
- `centerXWithinMargins`
- `centerYWithinMargins`
- `edgesWithinMargins`

These can be further refined using the following operators: `*`, `/`, `+` and
`-`.

Additionally, it supports convenient compound attributes that allow you to
assign multiple attributes at once:

```swift
constrain(view) { view in
    view.size   == view.superview!.size / 2
    view.center == view.superview!.center
}
```

```swift
constrain(view) { view in
    view.edges == inset(view.superview!.edges, 20, 20, 40, 20)
}
```

### Aligning multiple view

If you need to align multiple views by a common edge, you can use the `align`
functions:

```swift
constrain(view1, view2, view3) { view1, view2, view3 in
    align(top: view1, view2, view3)
}
```

Which is equivalent to `view1.top == view2.top; view2.top == view3.top`. Similar
variants exist for `top`, `right` `bottom`, `left`, `leading`, `trailing`,
`centerX`, `centerY` and `baseline`.

### Distributing views evenly

For distributing multiple views, either horizontally or vertically, you can use
the `distribute` functions:

```swift
constrain(view1, view2, view3) { view1, view2, view3 in
    distribute(by: 10, horizontally: view1, view2, view3)
}
```

Which is equivalent to `view1.trailing == view2.leading - 10; view2.trailing == view3.leading - 10`.

## Setting priorities

You can set the priorities of your constraints using the `~` operator:

```swift
constrain(view) { view in
    view.width  >= 200 ~ 100
    view.height >= 200 ~ 100
}
```

## Capturing constraints

Since the `==`, `>=`, `<=` and `~` emit `NSLayoutConstraint` instances, you can
capture their results if you need to refer to the layout constraints at a later
time:

```swift
var width: NSLayoutConstraint?

constrain(view) { view in
    width = (view.width == 200 ~ 100)
}
```

Note that declaring compound attributes returns multiple constraints at once:

```swift
var constraints: [NSLayoutConstraint]?

constrain(view) { view in
    constraints = (view.size == view.superview!.size ~ 100)
}
```
